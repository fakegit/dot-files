# dot-files

A bunch of misc scripts and config files I use in all my operating systems.
There is a `bootstrap.sh` but it's mostly for calling from my `server-init`
project and not very friendly to other people at the moment.

## Submodules

I use a few various submodules for vim bundles. To install them after the git
clone run:

    git submodule update --init
